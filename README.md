# MyGame - A Personal Project by Jordan Watterston

## What is this Project?

This *untitled* game will be my personal project for this term. My general vision for this project is to be a simple
turn based strategy game that the player will control with the mouse. The game will import PNG's as art asset's that
will be royalty free. The game will also have a sound component for a backing track and sound effects. The scope will
be limited to this specification to not over complicate things. My interest for this project stems from the fact that
I love video games and am very interested in this specific part of computer science as a career. I do not believe we
are allowed to use external libraries such as Unity to make this project, so I will keep the game basic in its nature
to make it attainable within this course.

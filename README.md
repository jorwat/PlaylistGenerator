# MyPersonalPlaylist - A Personal Project by Jordan Watterston

## What is this Project?

This application will be a sort of interface for the user to input songs and put those songs into a playlist. A playlist
is collection of songs that can either be a collection based on **genre, artist, or by user selection**. The application 
should have a user interface that lets the user either input a song, view playlists, or play the song within the
application. Depending on how my experience increases through the term, I may increase the scope of the project, but
initially I would like these basic functions. People who want a tailored collection of their music will use this
application. This project is of interest to me as I listen to music all the time, so It would be interesting to
understand how this functionality is built into my day to day applications.

## User Stories

- As a user, I would like to create a custom playlist with a custom name
- As a user, I would like to input a custom song with a name, artist and genre
- As a user, I want to know how long my playlist is
- As a user, I would like to view my playlists

that way all my playlists are saved, with song amounts and length.
- As a user, I would the option to have the application open up my library automatically without having
